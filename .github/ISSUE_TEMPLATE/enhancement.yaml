        Please clearly describe the feature you would like to see added to Kubemox.
        It might be either a new CRD, a new field to existing CRDs or an updated reconciliation logic for an existing CRD. 
        Kubemox is well designed to be extensible and flexible but make sure that what you had requested is feasible and exists in Proxmox API.
